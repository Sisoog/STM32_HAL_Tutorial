<h1> Example project for transmitting data via USART unit </h1>
<b>This project is created for STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (Blue Pill board)</b>

in this project, USART1 of the microcontroller is activated and an arbitrary word (Connectd!) is transmitted throuth USART1.TX. this data can be received by a TTL to USB converter and we can see it on computer by using a Serial Terminal(such Real Term)
