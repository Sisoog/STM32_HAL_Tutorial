<h1> Example project for receiving data via USART unit </h1>
<b>This project is created for STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (Blue Pill board)</b>

in this project, USART1 of the microcontroller is activated and then arbitrary data is received in non-blocking mode and throuth USART1.RX. this data can be send by a TTL to USB converter and we can see it on computer by using a Serial Terminal(such Real Term).
