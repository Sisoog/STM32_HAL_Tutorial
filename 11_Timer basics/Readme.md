<h1> Example project for timer </h1>
<b>This project is created for STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (Blue Pill board)</b>

in this project some simple applications of timers in timer and counter modes are shown. TIM2 of the microcontroller is configured to measure time in seconds and also to make a LED blink and TIM1 is used to count the number of times, a button is pushed.
