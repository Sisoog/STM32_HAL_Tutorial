<h1> Example project for GPIO input/output (Blinking LED) </h1>
<b>This project is created for STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (Blue Pill board)</b>

in this project pin13 of the portC of the Micro is set as output and pin12 of the portB is set as input, then with seting and reseting the input, LED that is connected to pin13 is turned-on and off accordingly.
