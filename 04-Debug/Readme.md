<h1> Sample project for introducing debug in STM32CubeIDE </h1>
<b>This project is created for STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (Blue Pill board)</b>

in this project debuging in STM32CubeIDE is inspected. for this porpose, an integer value is defined and then incremented with each step in debug mode. this variable is added in watch.
